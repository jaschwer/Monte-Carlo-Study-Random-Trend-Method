    "# 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We construct a simulation for a random-trend (RT) model as defined by [Wooldrige 2010](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/econometric-analysis-cross-section-and-panel-data),  section 11.7.1. The model is an extension of the [fixed-effects (FE) model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model) for panel-data and overcomes some deficiencies. Our main interest is to find an unbiased estimator after a linear random-trend has already introduced some bias in the classical panel estimation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic model to estimate a dependent variable follows a linear panel data specification. The specific model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{it} = \\beta \\cdot x_{it} + u_{it} \\quad (1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are working with a panel, the index $i$ stands for an individual (person, company, country, etc.), while the index $t$ represents time. The dependent and the independent variables are respectively indicated by $y_{it}$ and $x_{it}$ and vary both over the individuals and over the time dimension. The error term is represented by $u_{it}$. This can be decomposed into three terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_{it} = \\alpha_i + e_{it} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context $\\alpha_i$ is an unobserved individual specific effect that stays constant for each individual and $e_{it}$ is an idiosyncratic error that changes both over time and over individuals. In practice we are mostly interested in estimating the effect of $x$ on $y$ and so we are looking for an unbiased and consistent estimation of $\\beta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that both $x$ and $y$ are correlated with the first two parts of the error term, using just normal OLS without any data-transformation (pooled regression) will give biased results ([omitted variable bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I1tUM0RB6I)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To methods can be used to deal with the ommited variable bias induced by the constant error term: The fixed-effects (FE) and the first-differecen (FD) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed-effects (FE) method can handle situations by the so-called within transformation, subtracting the mean from each variable corresponding to each individual. This eliminates the individual-specific effect which is constant over time (here: $\\alpha_i$) and allows for a standard [OLS estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares). \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{it} - \\bar{y}_{i} = \\beta \\cdot (x_{it} - \\bar{x}_{i} + \\alpha_i - \\alpha_i + e_{it} - \\bar{e}_{i} \\quad (2)$$ with $\\bar{y}_{i} = \\sum_{t=1}^T y_{it}$, $\\bar{x}_{i} = \\sum_{t=1}^T x_{it}$ and $\\bar{e}_{i} = \\sum_{t=1}^T e_{it}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first-differences achieves to control for the bias be taking substracting the past observation from the current one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{it} - y_{it-1} = \\beta \\cdot ( x_{it} - x_{it-1}) + \\alpha_i - \\alpha_{i} + (e_{it} - e_{it-1}) \\quad (3) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can clearly see that in both methods the $\\alpha_i$ cancels out of the regression, solving a possible correlation between $\\alpha_i$ with $y_{it} $ and $x_{it}$. Still, a crucial requirement for retrieving reliable estimates is that the independent variable and the idiosyncratic term remain uncorrelated in expectations.     \n",
    "\n",
    "Things get complicated however, when besides the unobserved constant ($\\alpha_i$), the variable of interest ($x_{it}$) is correlated also with a linear trend ($g_i \\cdot t$). Keeping the variable names as before, the error term can be decomposed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_{it} = \\alpha_i + g_i \\cdot t + e_{it} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $g_i$ is a linear trend which is specific for each individual. Note that if $y_{it}$ is a logarithm of the original variable, $g_i$ can also be interpreted as roughly the average growth rate over a period. Overall, this presents an additional source of heterogeneity and needs to be dealt with before employing an OLS estimation.      \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the possible bias problem due to the random-trend component, the literature just states that in the first step we have to calculate the first-differences in order to transform the linear trend into a constant. Thereafter, it is up to the researcher to continue with either the within-transformation or the first-difference (even though both are fixed-effect methods, we will be consistent with the literature to call the within-transformation the fixed-effect method). We will investigate if one of the approaches is superior to the other in means of the estimation bias of the coefficient [<span style=\"color: red\">???, standard errors and model selection criteria ($R^2$, AIC and BIC)???</span>].\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the first-difference in the RT set-up gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{it} - y_{it-1} = \\beta \\cdot ( x_{it} - x_{it-1}) + \\alpha_i - \\alpha_{i} +   g_i \\cdot t - g_{i} \\cdot (t-1) + (e_{it} - e_{it-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\iff \\Delta y_{it} = \\beta \\cdot \\Delta x_{it} + g_i + \\Delta  e_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can see that the linear trend is reduced to a constant term which can be canceled out by a second first-difference or an with-transformation. So, we have two possibilities for estimation given the RT model: \n",
    "- The **FD Method**: Taking two times the first-difference, will be named _pure_ in the tables later on\n",
    "- The **FD-FE Method**: First the first-difference, then the fixed-effect, named _mix_.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: red\"> [Daniel: this part is a bit unclear to me. Jakob: Can you be more precise what you don't understand. This part just shows that if we indeed use the **FD Method** or the **FD-FE Method** will cancel out the remaining constant term given by $ g_i$.] \n",
    "\n",
    "First-differencing leads to:\n",
    "$$\\Delta^2 y_{it} = \\beta \\cdot \\Delta^2 x_{it} + \\Delta^2 e_{it} \\quad (4) $$, whereby $\\Delta^2$ stands for the taking two first-differences.  \n",
    "The FE transformation for each variable is to subtract from it the mean corresponding to each individual:\n",
    "$$\\Delta y'_{it} = \\beta \\cdot \\Delta x'_{it} + \\Delta e'_{it} \\quad (5) $$\n",
    "where ' denotes that the variables are demeaned.\n",
    "One can clearly see that we canceld out both terms $\\alpha_i$ and $g_i \\cdot t$. Thereby $\\beta$ will not be biased even though in the data included two different sorts of bias' in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking first the fixed-effects rather than the first-difference would give the following:\n",
    "$$y_{it} - \\bar{y}_{i} = \\beta \\cdot ( x_{it} - \\bar{x}_{i}) + \\alpha_i - \\alpha_{i} +   g_i \\cdot (t - \\bar{t}) + (e_{it} - \\bar{e}_{i})$$\n",
    "Using a second transformation we will not be able to cancel out the time trend effect (we will confirm this in the simulation at some point). We thereby see that it is crucial to first take the first-difference and not the within-transformation.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that our group is new to python but experienced in stata, we will first do the simulation via stata by using the package [`ipystata`](https://github.com/TiesdeKok/ipystata). Thereby we have a known language which we can refer to as our benchmark. In a second step we will use only open software packages to replicate the results. Thereby we will comment which python code is comparable to which stata code. Despide having the stata-results as a benchmark, we start a nice _translater_ from stata to python. We will also comment on the speed of both languages as well as advantages and disadvantages of the coding part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will continue as follows: (i) First we explain step by step our Data Generating Process (DGP). (ii) Then we run a simulation without a random trend to see if everything works fine. (iii) Next we run the same simulation using a constant linear trend and (iv) an individual specific trend in the data generating process. To see how robust the random-trend estimates are, we will further run two simulations using two non-linear trends.\n",
    "After that we will reproduce the results of the individual trend using open-source packages only.\n"

The option _sig_ prints significance level for each correlation. Results are presented above. There is a statistically significant correlation between $x_{it}$ and $\\alpha_i$ (77.64%). As a result, not including or solving for $\\alpha_i$ when regressing in a panel model $x_it$ on $y_{it}$ will produce biased estimates. The correlation of $x_{it}$ on $y_{it}$ and $\\alpha_i$ is naturally very high, since it depends on both variables in our set-up.\n",
    " The correlation of $e_{it}$ with $x_{it}$ and $\\alpha_i$ is very low and statistical insignificant, which is necessary and by construction. An OLS model like $y_{it} = \\beta x_{it}$  will be upward biased since the correlation of $\\alpha_i$ and $x_{it}$ is positive. $\\beta$ will estimate the effect of $\\alpha$ and $x_{it}$. If the correlation would be negative, it would have been downward biased.\n",
